# Boost-Geometry_Convex_Hull

I've created three files :-
1. `convex_hull_GW.hpp` present in the folder `includes` - implements the Gift Wrapping Algorithm
2. `convex_hull_example.cpp` present in the folder `example` - provides an example for the purpose of understanding the usage
3. `convex_hull_test.cpp` present in the folder `test` - provides a few test cases for the given algorithm

## Usage:-
1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Include the appropriate folder before "convex_hull_GW.hpp" header file in `convex_hull_example.cpp` and `convex_hull_test.cpp` (` include "home/username/Boost-Geometry_Competency_Test/include/convex_hull_GW.hpp"`
3. Run it!


## Contributions I've made to Boost::Geometry

### 1. https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/pull/665 [Merged]

Added an example of a dot product arithmetic operation involving different point concepts as operands. This aims to aid the user in understanding the concept more clearly when the user goes through the documentation.

### 2. https://github.com/boostorg/geometry/pull/660 [Merged]

Added an example of a cross product arithmetic operation involving different point concepts as operands. This aims to aid the user in understanding the concept more clearly when the user goes through the documentation.
