# Boost-Geometry_Competency_Test
This is part of the Gsoc '20 requirements for Boost::Geometry

I've created three files :-
1. `convex_hull_GW.hpp` present in the folder `includes` - implements the Gift Wrapping Algorithm
2. `convex_hull_example.cpp` present in the folder `example` - provides an example for the purpose of understanding the usage
3. `convex_hull_test.cpp` present in the folder `test` - provides a few test cases for the given algorithm

## Usage:-
1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Include the appropriate folder before "convex_hull_GW.hpp" header file in `convex_hull_example.cpp` and `convex_hull_test.cpp` (` include "home/username/Boost-Geometry_Competency_Test/include/convex_hull_GW.hpp"`
3. Run it!
